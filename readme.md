*   **Configurable Durations:** Easily adjust work, short break, and long break times via the settings panel.
*   **Work:Rest Ratio:** Configure how much break time you earn relative to your work time.
*   **Task Integration:**
    *   Fetches task categories from a local API (`http://localhost:13276/tasks_categories`).
    *   Fetches tasks based on the selected category (`http://localhost:13276/tasks`).
    *   Allows selecting a specific task to work on.
*   **LifeUp Integration:** Automatically sends completed Pomodoro cycles (total work time since last long break/reset) to the LifeUp app via its URL scheme when the **long break button is clicked** *and* a task is selected.
*   **Visual Progress:** Circular progress bar visually indicates time remaining.
*   **Mode Indicator:** Clearly shows whether you are in a "Work", "Break", or "Long Break" session.
*   **Stats Display:** Shows total work time accumulated (since last long break/reset) or earned rest time.
*   **Clean UI:** Simple interface built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
*   **PWA Ready:** Includes a manifest and service worker registration for potential installation.
*   **(Optional) Dark Mode:** Basic dark mode support can be enabled (requires uncommenting theme button and potentially adding CSS variables).

## How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   You need the LifeUp app installed on your device if you want to use the integration feature.
    *   You need the companion local server LifeUp Cloud running (which provides the `/tasks_categories` and `/tasks` endpoints, e.g., at `http://localhost:13276`).
2.  **Add to Furodoro to LifeUp shop:**
    *   First start the LifeUp Cloud Service.
    *   Search Furodoro in World -> Search `Furodoro`-> Market -> Import to add Furudoro to shop OR use [PWA](https://furodoro.pages.dev/). 
3.  **Select Task:** Choose a category and then a specific task from the dropdowns if you want the completed Pomodoro cycle to be logged against that task in LifeUp when you start a long break.
4.  **Start Timer:** Click the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to begin a work session.
5.  **Take Short Breaks:** Click the main button (now showing ‚è∏Ô∏è) during a work session to start a short break. The timer will switch to the calculated break duration. Click the main button (now showing ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) again during a short break to interrupt it and resume work immediately.
7.  **Take Long Breaks & Log to LifeUp:** After completing one or more work/short break cycles, click the long break button (üü∞).
    *   If a task was selected, the app will attempt to redirect to a `lifeup://` URL to log the total work time accumulated since the last long break/reset.
    *   The timer will then switch to the long break duration.
8.  **Adjust Settings:** Click the settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) to open the settings panel and customize timer durations.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (including CSS Variables / Custom Properties)
*   Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)

## Future Ideas

- [ ]   Add sound notifications for session completion.
- [x]   Implement the theme toggle button.
- [ ]   Persist selected task across sessions.
- [ ]   Add more robust error handling for API calls.
- [x]   Improve PWA offline capabilities (basic app shell caching implemented).
